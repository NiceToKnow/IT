# What is this?
It's a mindmap, just not as tree-like as others, but more area-focused.

It tells you stuff that's nice to know if you work in IT, and how this is connected. 
Also, you can “drill down on” or “zoom into” topics to find more specifics and useful information.

# So it's like a small Wikipedia?
No. This map is not about factual but contextual information. 
It gives an overview of how topics are related to each other. 
Also, it doesn't list *every* entry you might think of, only the most important ones. 

# So what is important?
In terms of information on a matter, a page should answer the questions
- What is it?
- What is it used for / particularly good at?
- How can I get it?
- What's a good starting point to get used to it?

In terms of entries just compare a topic to others in the same directory. 
Is yours equally important / great / noticable as the other? Go for it, add it!

# How can I add something?
That's the beauty of it: This how site is a folder structure in a github-project.
You can use the usual github-workflow (fork or branch, change, commit or create a pull request) 
or add an issue in the original repo.

# I still like tree-like mindmaps. Get I get those?
Sure, here you go:
